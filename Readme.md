# Metamaterials Agent: Forward Modeling & Inverse Design

LLM-driven agents that **train a forward surrogate model** (geometry → spectrum) and perform **Neural-Adjoint inverse design** (target spectrum → geometry). 

- 🔁 End-to-end workflow: data prep → forward training → inverse design
- 🧠 iterative code generation & evaluation
- 🧪 Neural-Adjoint backpropagation for inverse design
